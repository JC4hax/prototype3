          <h2>About the European Central Bank</h2>
          <p>
            The European Central Bank (ECB) is the central bank for the 20 European Union countries that have adopted the euro. Established in 1998, the ECB is headquartered in Frankfurt, Germany, and is one of the world's most important central banks.
          </p>
          
          <h3>What is the ECB's Mission?</h3>
          <p>
            The European Central Bank’s top priority is to keep prices stable in the euro area. This means making sure that inflation, which is the rate at which prices for goods and services increase, remains low, steady, and predictable. The ECB aims for 2 percent inflation over the medium term.<br>
          
            <strong>→This helps create the right conditions(also described as "temperature") for a healthy economy where prices do not rise too quickly or fall too much.</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            Maintaining an inflation rate of 2 percent is considered optimal for the euro area economy. This level is sufficiently low to ensure the benefits of price stability, while clearly demonstrating the ECB’s commitment to maintaining stable prices.<br>
            → <strong>A 2 percent target keeps prices steady and shows the ECB is dedicated to stability.</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            Targeting 2 percent inflation also provides a critical safeguard against deflation, which refers to a general decline in prices over time. Deflation can be harmful to the economy, as it limits the ability of monetary policy to stimulate growth by reducing interest rates. In such an environment, traditional monetary policy tools become less effective, making it more challenging to address deflation than to control inflation.<br>
            → <strong>The 2 percent target helps protect the economy from falling prices, which are harder to fight than rising prices.</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            In addition, a 2 percent inflation target offers several important advantages. It allows for smoother adjustment of economic imbalances between euro area countries, reducing the likelihood that individual countries will experience persistently negative inflation rates. It also takes into account the fact that wages are often slow to adjust downwards, which could otherwise lead to higher unemployment if inflation were too low. Finally, the target provides a margin for possible overestimation in official inflation measurements, ensuring that the real rate of inflation does not fall below a safe level.<br>
            → <strong>This target also helps countries adjust more easily, keeps unemployment in check, and ensures inflation is not accidentally too low.</strong>
          </p>

          <h3>How Does the ECB Work?</h3>
          <p>
            <strong>Governing Council – the main decision-making body.</strong><br>
            Consists of the Executive Board (see below) plus the governors of the national central banks from eurozone countries.<br>
            → <strong>This group makes all the big decisions for the ECB and includes leaders from countries that use the euro.</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Executive Board – handles the day-to-day running of the ECB.</strong><br>
            Consists of the ECB President and Vice-President and 4 other members appointed for 8-year terms by the leaders of the eurozone countries.<br>
            → <strong>This team manages the ECB's daily business and puts the Governing Council's decisions into action.</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>General Council – has more of an advisory & coordination role.</strong><br>
            Consists of the ECB President and Vice-President and the governors of the central banks from all EU countries.<br>
            → <strong>This group gives advice and helps coordinate between all the central banks in the European Union, not just those using the euro.</strong>
          </p>

          <h3>Monetary Policy Tools</h3>
          <p>
            The ECB uses several tools to implement monetary policy:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Interest Rates:</strong> The three main rates (refinancing, deposit, and lending) that influence borrowing costs throughout the economy.</li>
            <li><strong>Asset Purchases:</strong> Buying government bonds and other assets to inject money into the financial system.</li>
            <li><strong>Forward Guidance:</strong> Communicating future policy intentions to influence market expectations.</li>
            <li><strong>Long-term Refinancing Operations:</strong> Providing banks with long-term funding at favorable rates.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Decision-Making Process</h3>
          <p>
            The ECB Governing Council meets every six weeks to assess economic conditions and make monetary policy decisions. The process involves:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Analyzing economic data and inflation trends</li>
            <li>Considering financial market conditions</li>
            <li>Evaluating risks to price stability</li>
            <li>Making decisions by majority vote</li>
            <li>Communicating decisions and reasoning to the public</li>
          </ul>

        <h2>Why We Created ECB Lens</h2>
        <p>
          As high school students at the Cité Scolaire Internationale de Lyon, we noticed that many of our peers and families struggled to understand how ECB decisions affected their daily lives. Interest rate changes impact everything from mortgage payments to savings account returns, yet the connection often feels abstract and distant.
        </p>
        <p>
          We created ECB Lens to bridge this gap. Our platform combines real-time data, interactive visualizations, and clear explanations to make European Central Bank policy accessible to students, young professionals, and small business owners who are directly affected by these decisions.
        </p>
        <p>
          By breaking down complex monetary policy concepts and showing their real-world implications, we hope to empower people to make better financial decisions and engage more meaningfully with economic news and policy discussions.

            What is the difference between the three ECB rates?
          </div>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            The Main Refinancing Rate is the rate at which banks borrow from the ECB, the Deposit Facility Rate is what banks earn for depositing money overnight, and the Marginal Lending Rate is what banks pay for emergency overnight borrowing. Together, they create a corridor that influences all other interest rates in the economy.

            Why does the ECB target 2% inflation?
          </div>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            The 2% target provides a buffer against deflation (falling prices) while being low enough to maintain price stability. This level allows for economic growth while preventing the harmful effects of high inflation on purchasing power and economic planning.
